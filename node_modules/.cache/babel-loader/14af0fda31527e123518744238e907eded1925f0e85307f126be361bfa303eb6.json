Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nclass __PRIVATE_IndexedDbPersistence {\n  constructor(\n  /**\n   * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\n   * access to local persistence.\n   */\n  e, t, n, r, i, s, o, _, a,\n  /**\n   * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.

The Query Engine determines\n * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines\n * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all\n * implementations.\n *\n * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured\n * any index that can be used to execute query (via `setIndexConfiguration()`).\n * Otherwise, the engine will try to optimize the query by re-using a previously\n * persisted query result. If that is not possible, the query will be executed\n * via a full collection scan.\n *\n * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine\n * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index\n * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation\n * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all\n * queries that the backend supports.\n *\n * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target\n * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries\n * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query\n * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any\n * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.\n *\n * There are some cases when this optimization is not guaranteed to produce\n * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, query\n * processing falls back to full scans. These cases are:\n *\n * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer\n *   matches the query.\n *\n * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below\n *   another document that is in the local cache.\n *\n * - Queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents.\n */\nclass __PRIVATE_QueryEngine {\n  constructor() {\n    this.Rs = !1, this.Vs = !1,\n    /**\n     * SDK only decides whether it should create index when collection size is\n     * larger than this.\n     */\n    this.fs = 100, this.gs =\n    /**\n    * This cost represents the evaluation result of\n    * (([index, docKey] + [docKey, docContent]) per document in the result set)\n    * / ([docKey, docContent] per documents in full collection scan) coming from\n    * experiment [enter PR experiment URL here].\n    */\n    function __PRIVATE_getDefaultRelativeIndexReadCostPerDocument() {\n      // These values were derived from an experiment where several members of the\n      // Firestore SDK team ran a performance test in various environments.\n      // Googlers can see b/299284287 for details.\n      return isSafari() ? 8 : __PRIVATE_getAndroidVersion(getUA()) > 0 ? 6 : 4;\n    }();\n  }\n  /** Sets the document view to query against. */\n  initialize(e, t) {\n    this.ps = e, this.indexManager = t, this.Rs = !0;\n  }\n  /** Returns all local documents matching the specified query. */\n  getDocumentsMatchingQuery(e, t, n, r) {\n    // Stores the result from executing the query; using this object is more\n    // convenient than passing the result between steps of the persistence\n    // transaction and improves readability comparatively.\n    const i = {\n      result: null\n    };\n    return this.ys(e, t).next(e => {\n      i.result = e;\n    }).next(() => {\n      if (!i.result) return this.ws(e, t, r, n).next(e => {\n        i.result = e;\n      });\n    }).next(() => {\n      if (i.result) return;\n      const n = new QueryContext();\n      return this.Ss(e, t, n).next(r => {\n        if (i.result = r, this.Vs) return this.bs(e, t, n, r.size);\n      });\n    }).next(() => i.result);\n  }\n  bs(e, t, n, r) {\n    return n.documentReadCount < this.fs ?

Specifically the server splits paths into segments first and then\n * sorts, putting end-of-segment before any character. In a UTF-8 string\n * encoding the slash ('/') that denotes the end-of-segment naturally comes\n * after other characters so the intent here is to encode the path delimiters in\n * such a way that the resulting strings sort naturally.\n *\n * Resource paths are also used for prefix scans so it's important to\n * distinguish whole segments from any longer segments of which they might be a\n * prefix. For example, it's important to make it possible to scan documents in\n * a collection \"foo\" without encountering documents in a collection \"foobar\".\n *\n * Separate from the concerns about resource path ordering and separation,\n * On Android, SQLite imposes additional restrictions since it does not handle\n * keys with embedded NUL bytes particularly well. Rather than change the\n * implementation we keep the encoding identical to keep the ports similar.\n *\n * Taken together this means resource paths when encoded for storage in\n * IndexedDB have the following characteristics:\n *\n *   * Segment separators (\"/\") sort before everything else.\n *   * All paths have a trailing separator.\n *   * NUL bytes do not exist in the output, since IndexedDB doesn't treat them\n * well.\n *\n * Therefore resource paths are encoded into string form using the following\n * rules:\n *\n *   * '\\x01' is used as an escape character.\n *   * Path separators are encoded as \"\\x01\\x01\"\n *   * NUL bytes are encoded as \"\\x01\\x10\"\n *   * '\\x01' is encoded as \"\\x01\\x11\"\n *\n * This encoding leaves some room between path separators and the NUL byte\n * just in case we decide to support integer document ids after all.\n *\n * Note that characters treated specially by the backend ('.', '/', and '~')\n * are not treated specially here.

Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nexport class IndexedDbPersistence implements Persistence {\n  private simpleDb: SimpleDb;\n\n  private listenSequence: ListenSequence | null = null;\n\n  private _started = false;\n  private isPrimary = false;\n  private networkEnabled = true;\n  private dbName: string;\n\n  /** Our window.unload handler, if registered. */\n  private windowUnloadHandler: (() => void) | null = null;\n  private inForeground = false;\n\n  private serializer: LocalSerializer;\n\n  /** Our 'visibilitychange' listener if registered. */\n  private documentVisibilityHandler: ((e?: Event) => void) | null = null;\n\n  /** The client metadata refresh task. */\n  private clientMetadataRefresher: DelayedOperation<void> | null = null;\n\n  /** The last time we garbage collected the client metadata object store. */\n  private lastGarbageCollectionTime = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;\n\n  /** A listener to notify on primary state changes. */\n  private primaryStateListener: PrimaryStateListener = _ => Promise.resolve();\n\n  private readonly globalsCache: IndexedDbGlobalsCache;\n  private readonly targetCache: IndexedDbTargetCache;\n  private readonly remoteDocumentCache: IndexedDbRemoteDocumentCache;\n  private readonly bundleCache: IndexedDbBundleCache;\n  private readonly webStorage: Storage | null;\n  readonly referenceDelegate: IndexedDbLruDelegateImpl;\n\n  constructor(\n    /**\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\n     * access to local persistence.\n     */\n    private readonly allowTabSynchronization: boolean,\n\n    private readonly persistenceKey: string,\n    private readonly clientId: ClientId,\n    lruParams: LruParams,\n    private readonly queue: AsyncQueue,\n    private readonly window: WindowLike | null,\n    private readonly document: DocumentLike | null,\n    serializer: JsonProtoSerializer,\n    private readonly sequenceNumberSyncer: SequenceNumberSyncer,\n\n    /**\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.

Such a class could,\n * for example, have properties with complex, nested data types, properties used\n * for memoization, properties of types not supported by Firestore (such as\n * `symbol` and `bigint`), and helper functions that perform compound\n * operations. Such classes are not suitable and/or possible to store into a\n * Firestore database.

In this\n * context, this type is referred to as the \"DbModel\" and would be an object\n * suitable for persisting into Firestore. For convenience, applications can\n * implement `FirestoreDataConverter` and register the converter with Firestore\n * objects, such as `DocumentReference` or `Query`, to automatically convert\n * `AppModel` to `DbModel` when storing into Firestore, and convert `DbModel`\n * to `AppModel` when retrieving from Firestore.\n *\n * @example\n *\n * Simple Example\n *\n * ```typescript\n * const numberConverter = {\n *     toFirestore(value: WithFieldValue<number>) {\n *         return { value };\n *     },\n *     fromFirestore(snapshot: QueryDocumentSnapshot, options: SnapshotOptions) {\n *         return snapshot.data(options).value as number;\n *     }\n * };\n *\n * async function simpleDemo(db: Firestore): Promise<void> {\n *     const documentRef = doc(db, 'values/value123').withConverter(numberConverter);\n *\n *     // converters are used with `setDoc`, `addDoc`, and `getDoc`\n *     await setDoc(documentRef, 42);\n *     const snapshot1 = await getDoc(documentRef);\n *     assertEqual(snapshot1.data(), 42);\n *\n *     // converters are not used when writing data with `updateDoc`\n *     await updateDoc(documentRef, { value: 999 });\n *     const snapshot2 = await getDoc(documentRef);\n *     assertEqual(snapshot2.data(), 999);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Advanced Example\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // The Post class is a model that is used by our application.\n * // This class may have properties and methods that are specific\n * // to our application execution, which do not need to be persisted\n * // to Firestore.\n * class Post {\n *     constructor(\n *         readonly title: string,\n *         readonly author: string,\n *         readonly lastUpdatedMillis: number\n *     ) {}\n *     toString(): string {\n *         return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * // The PostDbModel represents how we want our posts to be stored\n * // in Firestore.
